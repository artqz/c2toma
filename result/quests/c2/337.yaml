walkthrough:
  en:
    - Talk to {npc:gabrielle}. She tells you to go visit 4 Seal Watchers.
    - Talk to {npc:magister_kaiena} on the 4th floor of the Ivory Tower.
      {npc:magister_kaiena} sends you the Blazing Swamp to kill
      {npc:marsh_stalker} and {npc:marsh_drake}. You probably want to take a
      friend or two.
    - The {npc:marsh_drake} and {npc:marsh_stalker} can be found on the very
      northern tip of the Blazing Swamp, where it bulges out into a small
      upside-down teardrop shape. Get {item:q_marsh_stalker_horn} and
      {item:q_marsh_drake_talon} and return to {npc:magister_kaiena}.
    - Two Seal Watchers are in Aden. Talk to {npc:highpriest_orven}.
    - Head east of Aden to the Forbidden Gateway again, take friends. Around
      here you find {npc:bloody_queen}. Kill them and about 6 Sacrificed Spirits
      will pop up. Once you get the {item:q_remains_of_sacrificed}, head back to
      {npc:highpriest_orven}.
    - Talk to {npc:master_kendra} (the other Seal Watcher who lives in Aden). He
      asks you to go kill {npc:harit_lizardman_shaman}.
    - Go into the Forest of Mirrors and follow the path as if going to the
      Anghel Waterfall. When you are almost there you should see lots of
      {npc:harit_lizardman_shaman}. Kill the Shaman until you get a
      {item:q_totem_of_earthdragon}, then take it to {npc:master_kendra}.
    - Go to Hunters' Village and talk to the last Seal Watcher,
      {npc:prefect_chakiris} A. {npc:prefect_chakiris} sends you to the Giant's
      Cave to kill {npc:kranrot} and {npc:hamrut}. You must take a group,
      preferably a big group; the Giant's Cave can be very deadly.
    - Once you have {item:q_kranrot_skin} and a {item:q_hamrut_leg}, return to
      {npc:prefect_chakiris}.
    - Go back to {npc:gabrielle} in Giran. She will send you to talk to two more
      Seal Watchers.
    - Go to Gludin to talk to {npc:warehouse_chief_moke}. He asks you to kill an
      {npc:abyssal_jewel_1} on the northeast coast. The {npc:abyssal_jewel_1} is
      just south of the mountains that divide Gludio territory from Dark Elf
      Territory, on the coast. Make sure to take a big group of friends, as the
      {npc:abyssal_jewel_1} has a lot of HP and a large number of helpers.
    - Once you get the {item:q_frag_of_abyss_jewel1} and the {item:q_mara_fang},
      return to {npc:warehouse_chief_moke}.
    - "Go to Oren to talk to {npc:blacksmith_helton}. He too has an
      {npc:abyssal_jewel_2} problem, and sends you to deal with it. This
      {npc:abyssal_jewel_2} is located near the Sea of Spores, just east of the
      dividing wall and against the southern mountain range. It works like the
      last one: high HP and lots of friends. Get the
      {item:q_frag_of_abyss_jewel2} and the {item:q_musfel_fang} and return to
      {npc:blacksmith_helton} in Oren."
    - Return to Giran and speak with {npc:gabrielle}.
    - Go to the west entrance of the Valley of Dragons and speak with
      {npc:watcher_antaras_gilmore}. He will tell you that there is one more
      {npc:abyssal_jewel_3} for you to face.
    - Go into the Valley of Dragons and kill {npc:cave_maiden} and
      {npc:cave_keeper} until the {npc:abyssal_jewel_3} appears. This one works
      like the last two, except it only has 4 minions.
    - Once you kill it and get the {item:q_frag_of_abyss_jewel3}, go to the
      entrance to the Lair of Antharas and talk to
      {npc:watcher_antaras_theodric}.
    - "{npc:watcher_antaras_theodric} gives you the {item:q_portal_stone_1}
      which will allow you to visit the Earth Dragon by talking to the
      {npc:heart_of_warding}, deep in Antharas' Lair!"
